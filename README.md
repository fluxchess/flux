Introduction
------------
Flux Chess is an attempt to write a computer chess engine entirely in 
Java. The speed of most Java Virtual Machines is improving nowadays. 
However compared to other C/C++ chess engines Flux is still slow (or 
maybe my algorithms are not that sophisticated?). 

As a pure UCI chess engine, Flux does not have a graphical user 
interface. You can load him however into your favorite chess program if 
it supports the UCI protocol.
